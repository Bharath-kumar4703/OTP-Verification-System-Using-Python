# OTP Verification System Using Python

## Overview
The OTP Verification System is a Python-based application that generates and verifies One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent via email. It features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

## Features
- **OTP Generation**: Generates a 6-digit OTP for verification.
- **Email Notification**: Sends the OTP to the user's email address.
- **OTP Verification**: Allows users to verify the OTP with limited attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Access to an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/otp-verification-system.git
   cd otp-verification-system
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required libraries. You can install any missing libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install smtplib
   ```

## Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python otp_verification.py
   ```
3. Enter your email address and click "Send OTP" to receive the OTP.
4. Enter the received OTP in the provided field and click "Verify OTP".

## Code Explanation

### Generating OTP
The `generate_otp` function creates a random 6-digit OTP.

### Sending OTP
The `send_otp` function sends the generated OTP to the specified email address using SMTP.

### User Interface
The `OTPApp` class defines the GUI for the application. It includes:
- Input fields for email and OTP.
- Buttons to send and verify the OTP.

### Verification Logic
Users have three attempts to enter the correct OTP. If the OTP is verified successfully, access is granted; otherwise, the user is informed of the remaining attempts.

## Important Notes
- Replace `sender_email` and `sender_password` in the `send_otp` function with your own email credentials.
- Ensure that "Allow less secure apps" is enabled in your Gmail account settings to send emails.
